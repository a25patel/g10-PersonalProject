I would like to do an image upload palette generator. My sit would allow users to upload a photo, once submitted the site would return a full color palette of the colors used in that photo. They would also have stats like hex codes, rgb values, percent of that hex code in the video etc.

I will be using forms, api, css, jade, express, mongo, node, monk, probably express validations to make sure users are uploading image files and not doc or ai files.

My mvp is mainly just figuring how to use the api with my forms and database and actually be able to get the user to upload a valid image and call back correct results in a nicely designed format

Stretch goals would be:
showing a database of previous images used
clicking on one color and being able to see all other images that contain that color by HEX code
use of cookies
users are able to create an account, store they're own specific images in a database ^ main database only shows images that are set to public
users can swap colors/delete colors not needed
users can get a psychology of color reading on that image OR users can get a personality reading of that image
